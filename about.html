                <p class="dur">During your engagement shoot or portrait session I will assist and direct you through
                    posing and expression to get you and your fiancée / partner comfortable in front of the camera so we
                    can incorporate both posed and natural moments on your special day.</p>

                <p class="dur">I love trying creative things in a fast paced environment. I adapt to any given situation
                    and try to bring the beauty out that is already there. This is your day, lets have fun with it and
                    make memories.</p>
                <p class="dur">I have won a boatload of awards for my work, and I’m grateful for every single one of
                    them, but I’ve always been unsure of whether I earned them or whether the jury was rigged. By now I
                    am literally addicted to making photos…for which there is no known cure, except to make more.</p>
